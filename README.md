# ML-course-outcomes

This repository contains my workings on the lectures and assignments as part of the [Machine Learning Foundations-A Case Study Approach](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations?specialization=machine-learning) course provided by the University of Washington on Coursera.

The course covers the following ML concepts:-

Regression

Classification

Clustering & Retrieval

Deep Learning

For hands-on, [Turi Create](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) and Jupyter Notebook have been used.
